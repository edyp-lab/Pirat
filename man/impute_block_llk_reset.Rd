\title{Impute each PG.}
\usage{
impute_block_llk_reset(
  data.pep.rna.crop,
  psi,
  pep_ab_or = NULL,
  df = 1,
  nu_factor = 2,
  max_pg_size = NULL,
  min.pg.size2imp = 1,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.pep.rna.crop}{A list representing dataset}

\item{psi}{Inverse scale parameter for IW prior of peptides abundances}

\item{pep_ab_or}{In case we impute a dataset with pseudo-MVS, we can provide the ground truth abundance table, 
such that imputation will by done only for pseudo-MVs. This will accelerate imputation algorithm.}

\item{df}{Estimate degree of freedom of the IG distribution fitted on observed variance.}

\item{nu_factor}{Multiplication factor on degree of freedom. 2 by default.}

\item{max_pg_size}{Maximum PGs size authorized for imputation. PG size is plitted if its size is above this threshold.}

\item{...}{xxx}

\item{prot.idxs}{Vector of indices of PGs to impute}

\item{max.pg.size2imp}{Maximum PG size to impute after splitting. PGs for which size is greater are not imputed. Should be lower than max_pg_size to have effect.}
}
\value{
A list containing imputation results for each PG, the execution time, and adjacency matrix between peptides and PGs corresponding to the imputed PGs.
}
\description{
Imputes each PG separately and return the results for each PG.
